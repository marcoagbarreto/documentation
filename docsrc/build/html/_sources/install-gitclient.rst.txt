Installing a Git Client
========================

Installing a Git Client is important if you plan on using GitHub as cloud based version manager. In my case I'm using GitKraken which is a Git Client with a visual GUI. Basically, it looks cool ad makes you look professional. GitKraken is available for Windows, Mac and Linux. I'm going to stick to the Windows installation.

.. Note::
	To use GitKraken you will need a student license. Head over to the `GitHub Student Developer Pack <https://education.github.com/pack?utm_source=github+gitkraken>`_ to :blue:`Get your pack`.

.. Note::
	If not a student you can always use free the `GitHub Desktop <https://desktop.github.com/>`_, same deal, different presentation. It is available for Windows and Mac. I will let you explore how to set it up on your own.
