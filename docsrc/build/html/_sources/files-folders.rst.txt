Folder & Files 
================

We are going to set some guidelines on how to keep your folders & files  the best way possible for your project.

File where?
************

Remember this, **ALL** of your documentation's files, basically, all of the ``.rst`` files must be in the ``source`` folder like so.

Images & Programs Folders
*****************************

Every project should have an ``images`` and ``programs`` folder contained in the ``source`` folder. 

.. image:: images/folder-image-program.png
   :class: screenshot
   
Respectively all of the project's images should be in the root of the ``images`` folder  as so.

Similar, if your project has to do with coding/programming, all of the code and programs must be in the root of the ``programs`` folder.

.. Attention::
	Do **NOT** try to create folders to separate files. This is a common mistake that leads into losing files locations.

.. Attention::
	If your programs use images create an ``images`` folder inside the ``programs`` folder. Do **NOT** mix the documentation's images with the programs' images.

File Naming
************

Use only lowercase alphanumeric characters and ``-`` (minus) symbol.

Files
------

File naming should be easy and intuitive. Use common words that describe the content of the file.

.. Note::
	1 file must correspond to 1 entry in the menu.

Images
-------

Image naming should be composed of minimum 2 words separated by a ``-``. The first word has to be related to the section or file you are writing in. The second word describes the image itself.

.. Attention::
	Avoid using number referencing. It can become a headache if you need to make arrangements to your files.
