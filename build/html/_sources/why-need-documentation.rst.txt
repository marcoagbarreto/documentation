Why do you need documentation?
******************************

Throughout the time working in the industry, personal projects and doing my masters. I’ve learned that documentation is essential to deliver good quality projects that people can understand. Moreover, when building a machine in the industry, documentation is mandatory to deliver costumers how to use, maintain, store and safety precautions for each machine. Also, it helps as a tool to pass over projects to other people. When you are done with the work and is time to pass it over to someone else in the team, those people need to know what you have done so far. Maybe one of the reasons to hand over the work could be because you no longer will work there, so is important to address every detail possible, so they can be able to continue with your work. True is, that the team will no longer have you near to ask you questions as where you saved the data or how did you deal with a specific problem. Most of the times, projects are not finished plug and play products, so it takes time to go through all the information available before running code or connecting equipment. Usually when you need to leave your work to some one else, sad story is that you might didn’t put time and effort to leave instructions to help the team or the next person. This is when damage control occurs, where files need to be recovered, probably re-do work to return to a functional point of the project.

You might be thinking right now, well, how am I going to glue all together and give it to the next persone. It is not simple; every person has a different work culture or habits. I hope this guide will help you to achive that goal. I will be discussing useful software, techniques and my personal workflow.

Remember, if documentation is sucking you a lot of your time and you are investing little into the main project. Then you are doing documentation all WRONG!! Keep in mind that you need to work on the project and documentation at the same time, so it is always up to date. And always, have fun!
