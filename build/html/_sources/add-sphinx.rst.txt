Adding Sphinx to My Project
****************************

The next thing we want to do is to build Sphinx into our project, so we can compile the project into a set of HTML files to visualize beautiful documentation.

.. Attention::
	If you haven't installed Anaconda and Sphinx you need to do it to follow this guide, check :doc:`install-anaconda` and :doc:`install-sphinx`.
		
#. Open the CMD.exe terminal using Anaconda Navigator.

#. Change directory to your project directory in the terminal using ``cd``, the path may be different for you.


	.. code-block:: python

		cd C:\Users\your_username\Documents\Projects\your_project
		
	.. image:: images/addsphinx-path.png
	   :class: screenshot
	   
#. Copy and paste the next line of code into the terminal to build Sphinx into your project folder.	   
	   
	.. code-block:: python

		sphinx-quickstart
			   
	.. image:: images/addsphinx-quickstart.png
	   :class: screenshot	   
	   
#. The quick start utility should now show. Follow the process by filling a project name, author, release number and language.
